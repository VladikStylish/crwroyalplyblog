      'The minimum stake in Buffalo Ways is a tad higher than what you might see in most games, and although it doesn’t sound like alot, it definitely rules Buffalo Ways out for a lot of players.

      '\n' +
      'Statistically, Buffalo Ways looks pretty solid with 12,000x win potential and a good 96.04% RTP figure. Games like this one has been deceptively good before, and we suspect that Buffalo Ways can do the same, so it’s well worth a spin just for that.\n',

      '\n' +
      'The Dynamite symbol will explode, causing itself and all other dynamite symbols to reveal a symbol of the same type.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This feature follows the same rules that the Base Game does in terms of where symbols need to be to connect, so if the revealed symbol is not on the left-most reel then the chain of symbols will miss.\n' +

      'The Collector Bonus can be obtained via 2 ways, one of which as mentioned previously, is by landing it on the bonus wheel. The other way is to land 3 or more Santa Scatter Symbols in the Base Game. 5 Spins will be awarded.\n' +

      'Golden Wheels may also land on one of the spaces, which will again award either an instant win, or more spins.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'This is where the game really starts to shine, with huge wins possible of up to 30,000x. The game doesn’t run on a ‘lives’ system unfortunately, so landing Santa on one of the spaces will only count towards getting up the ladder, and will not reset the spins\n',

If you assemble 3 different patterns in the Symbol Space, you will generate the Silver Super Reel, which is an additional spin that will have just the 3 generating symbols. In the same way, if you assemble 2 other symbols, you will get the gold rank, which will just contain those two generating patterns. At last, if you are blessed enough to assemble the same pattern, you’ll acquire a Superspin in which just that symbol will be available on the spin, which tells that you will be due for an assured epic win.\n' +

      'First feature to talk about is the wild feature, when a wild lands in the extra 3 boxes above it creates the reel below to become wild.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The second feature is the Hanzo free spins, this will be activated when 3 Hanzo symbols drop in the extra 3 boxes above. This will randomly select a symbol from lowest to highest symbol to be a fixed 3×3 symbol over the 2,3,4 reels. It will give one respin with this.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Finally, is the main free spins feature and this comes by getting 3 ‘FREE SPINS’ symbols. However, this has a unique feature of any ‘FREE SPINS’ symbol shown in the top 3 boxes comes with 1 more free spin and an activation of an extra feature during free spins. These are:\n' +

      'This game can be very volatile, not high end but enough to make your balance go quick. However, it has various potential parts to the game.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The Hanzo Wild Spin is hard to get, we haven’t seen or gotten it yet which suggests its difficult to hit. Also, Hanzo Spins are not easy to get but we would say you might get it once every 100 ish spins. The potential on these are not great.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The wild reel feature is nice and can keep a balance going but the beauty of the crown is the free spins and that’s where you will find the biggest hits. The basic 3 ‘FREE SPINS’ symbols in the main grid are not likely to give you a big win but if one of the 3 is in the top 3 boxes then it can go on a big roll.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The combinations of some of the extra features is where the big money comes in. We have seen a wild reel 5 and the nudge 3×3 which gave a 360x hit and to be honest could have been more with better symbols.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So if you can activate all 4 features I can see why they say it can pay 3000x. Overall the potential is mainly going to be 300x to 600x hits on the free spins with some of these extra features.\n',
